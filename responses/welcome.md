## Welcome to the Kubernetes kubectl Configuration Learning Lab

### In this lab you will learn to:

* Encrypt an existing Kubenernetes Config file and push it to a repository
* Add a secret to the GitHub repository secrets to decrypt the encrypted file
* Add the commands necessary to decrypt the file from within the workflow
* Run kubectl against a Kubernetes Cluster from within a workflow

### What you should know...

Those taking this lab should already be familiar with Git and GitHub basic commands.

It is important that you already have used kubectl with a Kubernetes cluster in a conventional way before attempting this lab. If you have not ever used Kubernetes kubectl before you will find a Kubernetes 'Quickstart' at the following link:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/

If you are familiar with kubectl and wish to consult the documentation on configuring kubectl in a conventional context, you may wish to consult this link:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/

### Testing this Lab's Workflow

If you have a live Kubernetes Cluster available, you will be able to use your actual Kubernetes kubectl config file in this lab, and run commands from a GitHub Actions Workflow against your live cluster.

### Estimated time to complete this lab

If you have the requisites setup, completion of this lab may be done in as little as 15 minutes.

### Proceeding through the steps of this lab...

Each step will be documented in an issue that will be created upon the closure of the current issue. To proceed through this lab, you simply close the issue when you have completed that step, and the next Step's issue will be created for you to proceed.

Please close this issue to proceed in this course.
